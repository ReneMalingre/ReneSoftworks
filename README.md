# Rene Softworks Portfolio

This project is a responsive portfolio website showcasing current development work, built using advanced CSS techniques such as CSS flexbox, grid, media queries, and CSS variables.

It is aimed at showcasing the developer's work and skills to potential employers and clients. This project is part of the University of Adelaide's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp,
and it showcases projects that the developer has worked on during the course of the bootcamp. As placeholders, there are currently screenshots of native Windows applications that the developer has previously created,
to be replaced in the portfolio by bootcamp projects as the bootcamp course progresses.

There are links to the deployed applications directly from the portfolio website.
